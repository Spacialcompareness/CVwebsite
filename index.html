                        I am a student at Thompson Rivers University completing my 
                        BS in computer science. My goal is to have my degree by
                        the spring of 2022. For the last five years I was working in the 
                        insurance industry in various positions. As of January 2021
                        I accepted a position as a credit analyst with a local credit union. 
                        This new position at a smaller company will hopefully provide me with 
                        opportunities to implement change by using the coding and computer 
                        science principles I learn in my studies.

                        <h3>Skiing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Skiing is one of my favourite activities. I am lucky enough to live between Whistler and Sun Peaks (a three hour drive 
                             to either) and have skied Lake Louise in Alberta (my favourite mountain).

                            <p>
                                Kelsey and I rescued Bruiser in 2017. He is a mini-poodle from California and we think he was probably homeless.
                                We liked the name Bruiser for him but, in all honesty, we should have probably named him "Biter".
